# kiss
Private version of KissBot

## Info
Since I host Kiss on Heroku via GitHub, I already have the repo on my account ([here](https://github.com/DudeVoid/kissbot)). 

**This means:**
I've directly forked over the repo and copied the files from there to here, that's why you'll see a Procfile and "node index.js" in the `package.json`.
